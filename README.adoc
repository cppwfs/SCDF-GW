= gwscdf

This is a Spring Cloud Gateway Project that offers a SCDF filter that will deploy the specified stream before sending the request to the URI target.

== Requirements:

* Java 8 or Above

== Classes:

* GwscdfApplication - the Spring Boot Main Application

* ScdfGatewayFilterFactory - the filter that can be applied to a route that will send a deploy request to a SCDF (located at http://localhost:9393) for the stream name located in the header with the key `scdf-stream-name`.

== Configuration

* application.yaml contains a route that will send a request to `http://localhost:8085` if the header contains `Host=localhost:8085`.  It will also apply the scdf filter that will look for the key `scdf-stream-name` in the header and attempt to deploy the stream contained in the value.
